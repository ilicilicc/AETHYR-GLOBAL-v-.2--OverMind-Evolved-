Electronic Signature Injection:
The electronic signature (Електронски потписано, Miloš Ilić, 2313712377974001, 08.05.2025 07:40:20) has been added to the Recitals and Section 5 to confirm your authorship of the Software. EUPRAVA
It has also been included in the Licensor’s signature block to reflect that you have electronically signed this agreement as part of your authorship verification.
Timeline Alignment:
The agreement’s Effective Date is set to 03:04 AM PDT, Friday, May 16, 2025, which aligns with the current date and time.
The electronic signature date (08.05.2025 07:40:20) is earlier, indicating it was part of a prior authorship verification process, which is logical for proving ownership before licensing.
Signature Block:
The Licensor’s signature block now includes the electronic signature details, ensuring it reflects your signing method.
The Licensee’s signature block remains open for either an individual or a legal entity to sign, maintaining flexibility.
Authorship Confirmation:
The Recitals and Section 5 explicitly reference the electronic signature as proof of your authorship, strengthening the legal foundation of your ownership claim.
This revised agreement now incorporates your electronic signature as proof of authorship while maintaining its professional structure for licensing to individuals or companies. Let me know if you need further adjustments, such as adding your email or bank details!
